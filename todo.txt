Stuff to do when finished:
* Delete v2.imutz.org from cloudflare and kloxo.
* Remove "v2" from $page_url and $page_image in head.php.

Fix:
* When screen size too small, dogs and cats should go below logo, not above.
* When screen size is even smaller, header-adoptcat and header-adoptdog should disappear completely.
